# Welcome to My Portfolio 👋  

Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. This portfolio is a little glimpse into who I am as a developer and the projects I’ve worked on. Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow developer, or just curious about my work, I hope you find something that catches your interest.  

## 🌟 About Me  

I’m a Front-End Developer with a knack for creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces. My journey started with HTML and CSS, and since then, I’ve dived deep into frameworks like **React** and styling with **Tailwind CSS**. Along the way, I discovered a passion for **problem-solving** and fell in love with **SQL** for its elegance in managing data.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech, working on challenging DSA problems, or tinkering with design ideas for web apps.  

## 💼 What’s Inside?  

Here’s what you’ll find in my portfolio:  

- **Projects**:  
  - A **Razorpay clone**, showcasing responsive design and interactive elements.  
  - A **Dynamic News Portal**, pulling real-time updates from APIs.  
- **Achievements**:  
  - RHCSA certified.  
  - 5★ Coder on HackerRank.  
  - Over 200+ DSA problems solved on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.  
- **Skills**:  
  - Front-End: React, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  
  - Back-End: Node.js.
